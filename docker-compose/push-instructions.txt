HOW TO INSTALL:

git pull... (of new repo)
cd docker
adjust env variables
docker-compose -p evatool up

TODO
- Get env vars into frontend
- Get env vars into backend
- Get mysql to start in not 5 minutes (!)
- Get docker-compose to work (only add keycloak)
- Make how to install and wiki stuff in new evatool repo (including everything in this folder)
- Deploy to UID server in both main deploy GitHub Actions
- use UID server as dev server and also as public demo?
