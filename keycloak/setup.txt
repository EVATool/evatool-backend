Import default realm (evatool-realm)

Create new realm:
- create new realm
- select the newly create realm realm
- create the client evatool-app
- select the newly created client
- set valid redirect and web to "*" (this is just so it works, this is not recommended due to security reasons)
- add roles (reader, writer)
- add users (admin [reader, writer], user [reader])
- set users passwords (NOT TEMPORARY)

There does not seem to be a way to automate this process.
